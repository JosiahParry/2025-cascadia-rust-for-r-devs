# Vectorizing

::: callout-tip

## Objective

Learn how to vectorize a Rust function and combine iterators.
:::

R users expect vectorized functions. In a high-level language like R "vectorized" simply means implementing the underlying loop in a compiled language like C/++ or Rust.

In the previous workshop we used `.iter()` and `.into_iter()` to iterate through single vectors. In this case we need to iterate through **two** vectors. How can we accomplish this?

## Combining iterators with `.zip()`

It is possible to combine iterators in Rust using `.zip()`.

We can combine iterators using the following syntax:

```rust
x.into_iter().zip(y.into_iter())
```

`.zip()` modifies each element of the iterator to be a tuple with two elements.

## Tuples

Tuples are the fundamental heterogeneous data type for Rust. They're much like tuples in Python.

```rust
let my_tuple = (1.0, "One");
```

Each element of the tuple can be accessed as if they were fields in a struct. To access the first element of the tuple we can use `my_tuple.0` and the second with `my_tuple.1`.

Tuples can be destructured in assignment too!

```rust
let my_tuple = (1.0, "One");
let (one_one, one_two) = my_tuple;
```

## Destructuring in an iterator

For example to find the parallel sum between two vectors:

```rust
fn psum(x: Vec<f64>, y: Vec<f64>) -> Vec<f64> {
    x
        .into_iter()
        .zip(y.into_iter())
        // destructure tuple in the closure
        .map(|(xi, yi)| {
            xi + yi
        })
        .collect::<Vec<_>>()
}
```

## Exercise

- Modify `x` and `y` to be `&[f64]`
- Change the return type to be `Vec<String>`
- Create a zipped iterator for `x` and `y`
- Map through the iterator and:
  - destructure the tuple in the closure (as in the above example)
  - Create a `Coord` struct in each iteration
  - `encode()` the coordinate
  - unwrap the result
- Collect the iterator into a `Vec<String>`
- Test this in R

## Generating random points

To help you test this function, I recommend using the following code:

```r
n <- 10
x <- runif(n, -180, 180)
y <- runif(n, -90, 90)

gh_encode(x, y, 10L)
```

```rust
#[extendr]
fn gh_encode(x: &[f64], y: &[f64], length: usize) -> Vec<String> {

    if length == 0 || length > 12 {
        throw_r_error("`length` must be between 1 and 12");
    }

    x
        .into_iter()
        .zip(y.into_iter())
        .map(|(xi, yi)| {
            let coord = Coord { x: xi, y: yi };
            encode(coord, length)
                .expect("Failed to encode the geohash")
        })
        .collect::<Vec<_>()
}
```

Run `rextendr::document()` and `devtools::load_all()` to register the changes to your function.

```r
n <- 10
x <- runif(n, -180, 180)
y <- runif(n, -90, 90)

gh_encode(x, y, 10L)
```
