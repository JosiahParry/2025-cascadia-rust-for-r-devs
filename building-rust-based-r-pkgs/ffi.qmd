# Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI)

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Understand the concept of FFI and broadly how it works with respect to R.

:::

Foreign function interfaces (FFI) are mechanisms by which other (foreign) languages can be used in our programming langauge of choice. They are typically used to call compiled languages (like C / Rust) from an interpretted langauge (R).

Much of R's success and power comes from a robust FFI tooling ecosystem. Some of the more prominent FFI libraries are:

| Package | Language |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org/) |  C++ |
| [cpp11](https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11) | C++ |
| [rJava](https://www.rforge.net/rJava/) | Java |
| [V8](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/V8) | JavaScript & WASM |


## R's C API

Most langauges have the ability to interact with C and C-types. R is written in C and exposes a C API. Rust is able to work with C and represent C types. This is where extendr comes in.
