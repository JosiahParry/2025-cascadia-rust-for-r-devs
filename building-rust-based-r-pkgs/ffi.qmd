# Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI)

- allows us to use other (foreign) languages in our language of choice
- R's success is in part due to FFI tools in our ecosystem:
    - Rcpp
    - cpp11
    - rJava
    - V8
    - etc
- made possible through R's C API
- Many low level langauges have the ability to talk to C types
    - So does Rust and that is where extendr comes in
