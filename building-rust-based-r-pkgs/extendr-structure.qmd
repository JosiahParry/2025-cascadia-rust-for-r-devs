# Package structure

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Understand the directory structure of extendr-based R packages.

:::

The basic structure of an extendr-based R package is like so:

```
.
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
├── R
├── configure
├── configure.win
├── man
├── src
└── tools
```

- `tools/`, `configure`, and `configure.win` are used at package build and install time to ensure that Rust is avaialble.
  - primarily for `R CMD check` and `CRAN` appeasement

## Compiled Code

R packages that have compile code must store the source in `src/`. The `src/` directory has the structure:

```
.
├── Makevars
├── Makevars.in
├── Makevars.win.in
└── rust
    ├── Cargo.lock
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── src
```

- `rust/` is a **library** crate that is linked to by R
- `Makevars` files builds the Rust library and links it to R

## Rust libraries

Rust library crates have `lib.rs` instead of `main.rs`. There is no entrypoint that gets executed. Instead, we define functions, structs, enums, etc.  that are used by the R package.
