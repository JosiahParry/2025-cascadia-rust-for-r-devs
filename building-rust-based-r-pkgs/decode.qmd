# Decode a geohash

::: callout-tip


:::

Naturally, if we have _encoded_ a geohash, we should be able to _decode_ the geohash as well. The challenge is that encoding takes an `(x, y)` pair into a bounding box. And we cannot go back to the original point, but instead we can get the center of the box with an error amount in x and y directions.

The `decode()` function has the signature:

```rust
fn decode(hash_str: &str) -> Result<(Coord<f64>, f64, f64), GeohashError>
```

The return is a tuple with 3 values
