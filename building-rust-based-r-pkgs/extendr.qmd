# What is extendr?


::: callout-tip
## Objective

Learn the different components of the extendr ecosystem.
:::

- extendr is a project that focuses on extending R with Rust
- there is actually no one library called "extendr"
- comprised of:
    - rextendr
    - extendr-ffi
    - extendr-api
    - extendr-engine

## extendr-ffi

- extendr-ffi is a crate that does the translation between R and Rust.
- R has many functions and types that are defined in C
- extendr-ffi provides Rust-compatible type definitions for the low-level C API
- we will never have to touch this
- but everything is built upon this layer

## extendr-api

- This is where the magic happens.
- extendr-api has defined types around extendr-ffi to make working with R structures in Rust ergonomic
- it is what we actually import and use when we create our R packages
- the rest of today will be focused on learning and using extendr-api1

## extendr-engine

- extendr-engine gives us a way to start R from inside of Rust
- if R exists on a machine, extendr-engine can access it, start it, and execute R code all from an R binary.
- this is very powerful for when we wantt to go the otherway Rust -> R
- we will not be touching it today

## rextendr

- it is a usethis-like package for Rust and R
- it creates package scaffolding for us
- we document our extendr packages with it
- helps us prepare our packages for CRAN releases
- also has a knitr engine that can be used to compile rust code into an R Markdown document
- we will be using this heavily today.
