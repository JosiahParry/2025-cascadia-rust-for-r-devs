title: Building Rust based R Packages
---

<!--
## Objective {.unnumbered}


- Learn how to create Rust based R packages using extendr
- Begin to feel comfortable working with data between R & Rust
- Create an R package to perform geohashing based on the Rust crate called `geohash`

In this workshop we will create a Rust-based R package to perform [geohashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGKs-c1nQYU) using [`extendr`](https://extendr.github.io/).

The first few sections of the workshop may be a litte "lesson" intensive and the latter portion light on it.

## General Overview

- What is FFI
- What is extendr
  - webR support
- R's C API
- `extendr-ffi` & `extendr-api`

## What is a geohash?

- not everyone is a geospatial nerd but i am
- i have 2 videos on this exact concept
- a third video that goes through making this package that inspired this workshop
- Super quick review of what a geohash is

## Hello, World!

- Creating a new package `usethis::create_package(rstudio = FALSE)`
- Add extendr `rextendr::use_extendr()`
- package structure
  - previous workshop used a binary crate, we will be building a library crate
- `rextendr::document()`
- `devtools::load_all()`
- `hello_world()`
- review the contents
- `#[extendr]` attribute macro
- `rprintln!()`

## rextendr DX

- show the VS Code settings
- running `cargo check`

## Adding dependencies

- add geohash dependency
- `rextendr::use_crate()`
- import structs and functions
- import  `Coord` and `encode()`

## A new R function

- create a basic function `gh_encode()` that takes an `x: f64` and a `y: f64` value and prints the coordinate
- next exercise add 3rd argument for length which is `[1:12]` it's `usize`

## Throwing R errors

- let's add validation with `throw_r_error()`
- check that the goehash length is appropriate range
- if not, throw and error

## Calling Rust From R

- add `#[extendr]` macro to the function
  - this does magic behind the hood to make it _callable_ from R
- the function _must_ be added to `extendr_module! {}` for it to be available
- run `rextendr::document()` for the new changes to take place
- `devtools::load_all()` to make the function available

## Encoding a geohash

- lets finish up our first function which will geohash a single coordinate by calling `encode()`
- `encode()` returns a `Result<String>`
- a `Result<>` is a special type of `Option<>`
- we will talk about handling errors gracefully in R later when we cover NA handling
- for now we will `.unwrap()` the result right away
- add the return type as `String`
  - extendr will handle converting this into a character vector

## Vectorize geohash encoding

- modify `gh_encode()` to take a `Vec<f64>` for both `x` and `y`
- We will iterate through these _together_
- review `.zip()` to merge iterators
- for each element in the iterator we encode the geohash
- collect to strings
- rextendr::document()
- devtools::load_all()

test in R

```r
x <- rnorm(100, -180, 180)
y <- rnorm(100, -90, 90)
gh_len <- 7

gh_encode(x, y, gh_len)
```

- What about handling errors and NAs?
- Gonna need to address type mapping first

## Type Mapping

- vecs are fine for basic stuff.
- R types are more complex and have support for NULL and NA values
- Scalar types
- Vector types
- NULL in R
- Robj
- Rust has the unit type `()`. We can tu

## R's type system

- Everything is an SEXP
- Briefly discuss representations
- I thought really hard on whether or not to discuss this. Initially i thought i wouldnt, but i think it is actually really helpful to understand the fundamental data structures in R. It helps make the mental leaps much easier.
- So we're going to spend a few minutes discussing internal representations in R

## Robj  & SEXP

- in extendr, everything can be represented as an Robj
- Robj is an opaque type: we do not know what type it is, we just know its an Robj
- a helpful catch-all
- we can turn any extendr type into an `Robj` using the `.into_robj()` method


## Scalars

- NA aware types that correspond to R's type system
- every scalar has `na()` method

### Doubles

- internally represented by f64
- access the inner f64 value using `.inner()`
- Convert `f64` to an `Rfloat` using `Rfloat::from(x)`


## Strings

- A bit of a nightmare
- Create `Rstr` from a `String` in Rust using `Rstr::from(x)`

## Using extendr types

- rewrite `gh_encode()` to use `Doubles` and `Strings`
- we can leave length as usize for now as it will always be scalar.
- to access the inner value of an `Rfloat` use `.inner()`
-

## Error handling in Rust

> "And I think Result can be explained fairly quickly in the following way: Rust does not have exceptions. Errors are data. If a function is falliable, it returns Result, which is a fork between the successful value, and the error-as-data. We may ignore the error-branch entirely with .unwrap." -Mossa

- Handle errors gracefully on the R side by returning a NULL or NA value when it is appropriate
- describe `Result<>` which is an enum.
- let's match on the result from `encode()`
  - when `Ok(gh)` use `Rstr::from(gh)`
  - when `Err(e)` use `Rstr::na()` to record a missing value
- when we try to encode data that is not in long lat we will get an error—e.g. if its in meter that wont work
- for the exercise feed some bad data to the function to see it return an NA

## NA handling

- now what about when the coordinates are NA?
- how do we handle that?
- we can check `Rfloat::is_na()`
  - if either `Rfloat::is_na()` return `Rstr::na()`
  - else, do the geohash
- test with NA values

## Geohash Neighbor

- A geohash is a square grid
- each location has up to 6 neighbors
- to find a specific neighbor we can use the `neighbor()` function
- this function takes an enum for direction

## Enums in R

- first step, lets make a utility function to take a `String` and convert this to the enum

```r
gh_neighbor <- function(gh, neighbor = c("N","NE","E","SE","S","SW","W","NW")) {
  arg.match(neighbor)
  # function body
}
```

## Custom Enum handling

- match statements can be used on strings too
- there will be a catch all part of the match
- in the function

```rust
fn as_direction(direction: String) -> Direction {
    match direction.to_lowercase().as_str() {
        "n" => Direction:N,
        "ne" => Direction:NE,
        "e" => Direction:E,
        "se" => Direction:SE,
        "s" => Direction:S,
        "sw" => Direction:SW,
        "w" => Direction:W,
        "nw" => Direction:NW,
        _ => throw_r_error("Invalid geohash neighbor direction")
    }
}
```

## Single Neighbor function

Exercise

- Create a function `gh_decode()`
- returns `Option<String>`
- takes 2 args:
  1. `geohash: String`
  2. `direction: String`
- cast the direction to the  `Direction` enum
- pass into the `neighbor()` function
- If there is an error in the result, return `None`
- If successful return `Some(geohash)`
- document and run the function in R to see the result
- test with bad data


## Vectorize the neighbor function

- Modify `gh_decode()` to take `geohash: Strings`
- Returns `Strings`
- Use `.into_iter().map().collect::<String>()` to return a vector of neighbors
- Handle NA values for geohash, return an `Rstr::na()`
- Handle errors return `Rstr::na()`
- Otherwise return `Rstr::from()`
- Collect into Strings


## Decoding a geohash

- a geohash isn't a coordinate, but rather a bounding box
- the `decode()` function decodes into a center point and error in two directions
- The signature is `pub fn decode(hash_str: &str) -> Result<(Coord, f64, f64), GeohashError>`
- the `Coord` is a "generic" struct it has fields x & y and the x & y error
- most natural way to work with this in R would be to create a data frame
- How can we create a data frame in extendr?
- there's a few ways. We're going to go ahead and create one from scratch

## What is there to a data.frame?

> data.frames are just lists masquerading as a rectangle

- named vectors
- structs are record based not column based (this is kinda the whole thing about apache arrow)
- How can we handle this?
- using an iterator isn't the most logical for this. Instead, we can use a for loop
- we can allocate our own vectors and then fill them in a for loop

## Tuples

- The decode function returns a tuple which we haven't yet covered.
- tuples are the heterogeneous collection type in Rust
- if you've used tuples in python they're pretty much the same
- elements in the tuple are not named
- generally good for holding only a handful of items, otherwise just define a struct
- we access elements from the tuple via `.0`, `.1`, `.2`
- We can perform destructuring assignment of tuples too which will be handy
-


## Creating vectors

- `Doubles`, `Strings`, and `Logicals` are wrappers around R types
- We can collect into these types or we can create them
- We can allocate empty vectors using associated method `Doubles::new(usize)`
    - But filling these is actually somewhat slow due to the FFI boundary
- Associated method `Doubles::from_values()` to collect values into a vector
  - Store `Vec<Rfloat>`
  - Collect from the vector

## Creating `data.frame`s

- There are two primary ways of creating data.frames in extendr
- I recommend using the `data_frame!()` macro
- this returns an untyped R object: `Robj`
-

### Exercise

- create 4 empty vectors to store:
  - x, y, x_error, y_error
- Create a for loop on the `geohash` note you have to call `.into_iter()` explicitly
-

```rust
fn gh_decode(geohash: Strings) -> Robj {
    let mut x_res = Vec::new();
    let mut y_res = Vec::new();
    let mut x_error = Vec::new();
    let mut y_error = Vec::new();

    for gh in geohash.into_iter() {
        let resi = decode(gh);
        match resi {
            Ok((Coord { x, y }, xe, ye)) => {
                x_res.push(Rfloat::from(x));
                y_res.push(Rfloat::from(y));
                x_error.push(Rfloat::from(xe));
                y_error.push(Rfloat::from(ye));
            }
            Err(_) => {
                x_res.push(Rfloat::na());
                y_res.push(Rfloat::na());
                x_error.push(Rfloat::na());
                y_error.push(Rfloat::na());
            }
        }
    }

    data_frame!(
        x = Doubles::from_values(x_res),
        y = Doubles::from_values(y_res),
        x_error = Doubles::from_values(x_error),
        y_error = Doubles::from_values(y_error)
    )
}
```


## Geohash Neighbors

- We already made a vectorized functioon to find neighbors in a single direction.
- but there is also a function `neighbors()` that returns a struct `Neighbors` that has the geohash for _all_ neighbors
- This would be a nice function to have access to in R
- how should we do this?
- we can take a similar approach we did for `gh_decode()`
- But that's a lot of boiler plate!
- There's another approach to this
- `IntoDataFrameRow` trait which we can derive

## Traits

- in the previous workhop we used the `#[derive()]` attribute to be able to have debug printing
- what is a trait?
- are similar to object oriented programming
- they define behaviors that a type can perform
- they are how we share behavior across rust libraries
- they're common methods that can be implemented for any type you own
- many traits can be "derived" this means you can get them on your type "for free" without doing work

# `IntoDataFrameRow` trait

- the `IntoDataFrameRow` trait is a helper trait to take a `Vec<T>` and turn it into a data frame in R
- it is a one-way trait
- since dataframes are column oriented but structs are row-oriented we can only go one way at the moment
- each field in the struct becomes a column in R
- so it would be nice if we can derive this for the Neighbors struct

### Example

```rust
#[derive(IntoDataFrameRow)]
struct Point {
    x: Rfloat,
    y: Rfloat,
}

#[extendr]
fn make_points(x: Doubles, y: Doubles) -> Robj {
    x.into_iter()
        .zip(y.into_iter())
        .map(|(xi, yi)| Point {
            x: xi.clone(),
            y: yi.clone(),
        })
        .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        .into_dataframe()
        .unwrap()
        .into_robj()
}
```
```r
n <- 10
x <- runif(n, -180, 180)
y <- runif(n, -90, 90)

make_points(x, y)
#>             x          y
#> 1   153.79235  51.577234
#> 2   162.48952 -12.125679
#> 3   145.49589 -51.865901
#> 4  -115.30154 -40.289614
#> 5    66.23683  71.941302
#> 6   163.38766  -9.811993
#> 7   -45.73522 -13.195039
#> 8   -93.75467 -70.093101
#> 9   104.26631 -41.306501
#> 10  -99.78657   8.136069
```

## Deriving IntoDataFrameRow for Neighbors

- lets try deriving it
- lol oops! That sucks! we cant implement traits for types we don't own.
- this is called the "orphan rule"

## Work-around: create your own struct

- one way to handle this is to create your own struct that you can implement traits on
- we can create our own struct `GHNeighbors`
- Since we **own** `GHNeighbors` we can derive `IntoDataFrameRow` for it
- but how do we go from `Neighbors` to `GHNeighbors`?
- we can implement a trait `From`

## `From` trait

- part of the standard library
- this provides a 0-cost abstraction
- lets us go from `T` to `U` without incurring any runtime cost
- use the `impl` keyword to implement a trait
- `impl Trait for OurType`
- The `From` trait requires us to specify a type:
- `impl From<ForeignType> for OurType`

### Example

```rust
impl From<Coord<f64>> for Point {
    fn from(value: Coord<f64>) -> Self {
        Point {
            x: Rfloat::from(value.x),
            y: Rfloat::from(value.y),
        }
    }
}
```

This lets us do something like:

```rust
let coord = Coord::zero();
let p = Point::from(coord);
```



Pro-tip if you write:

```rust
impl From<T> for U {
    // have cursor here and type `cmd + .`
}
```

- This opens the "Quick fix"
- press "implement missing members" which fills the template:

```rust
impl From<T> for U {
    fn from(value: T) -> Self {
        // construct Self / U struct here
        todo!()
    }
}
```

## Default trait

- what happens when we run into an error finding the neighbors?
- we want to be able to return a row of NAs
- rather than constructing the whole thing from struct each time we want to use a full row of NA
- we can actually instead, implement a default value
- note often the default trait can be derived

### Example

```rust
impl Default for Point {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            x: Rfloat::na(),
            y: Rfloat::na(),
        }
    }
}
```

### Exercise

Implement the `Default` trait for `GHNeighbors`
```rust
impl Default for GHNeighbors {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            sw: Rstr::na(),
            s: Rstr::na(),
            se: Rstr::na(),
            w: Rstr::na(),
            e: Rstr::na(),
            nw: Rstr::na(),
            n: Rstr::na(),
            ne: Rstr::na(),
        }
    }
}
```

This lets us write `GHNeighbors::default()`

## Put it all together

- lets combine the use of our implementations of `From`, `Default`, and `IntoDataFrameRow` row to write `gh_neighbors()`

### Exercise

```rust
#[extendr]
fn gh_neighbors(geohashes: Strings) -> Robj {
    let all_rows = geohashes
        .into_iter()
        .map(|gh| match neighbors(gh.as_str()) {
            Ok(nbs) => GHNeighbors::from(nbs),
            Err(_) => GHNeighbors::default(),
        })
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();

    all_rows.into_dataframe().unwrap().into_robj()
}
```
