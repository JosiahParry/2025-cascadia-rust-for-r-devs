Define the scope and objective of the workshop.

There's no better way to learn than by doing.

In this workhop we will learn how to use extendr and create Rust-powered R package by creating a new package called `{geohashrs}`. The `{geohashrs}` R package will provide R bindings to the [geohash crate](https://docs.rs/geohash).

Throughout the workshop we will touch on:

- Advanced R topics
- Rust concepts
- Techniques for bridging the two

As much as this is about Rust, we are also working within the confines of R and thus, he two are inextricably linked.

## What is geohashing?

- Geohashes are a way to encode a location on earth as a string of 1 - 12 characters.
- The more shared characters there are between two geohashes, the closes in physical space the geohashes are.
- Used to find approximately near locations.
- Used frequently in databases and web development to quickly query results.

## The R package

The R package we will create will help us:

- encode geohashes
- decoded geohash to x & y plus error terms
- decode geohash into a bounding box
- find geohash neighbors
