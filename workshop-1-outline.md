# Intro to Rust for R Developers

- what is Rust
- compiled vs interpreted lanuage
- strongly typed
- rustup vs rustc vs cargo
- hello world
  - `cargo run`
- primitive types
  - scalars
- vectors
- iteration with for loops
- mutable variables
- logical operators
  - use `&&` and `||` there is no vectorized version
  - we do everything on the primitive types

## Function Ideas:

- is_odd
  - meme opportunity here https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd
- parallel minimum
- average
- centroid
- euclidean distance
  - use this to demonstrate vectorization
