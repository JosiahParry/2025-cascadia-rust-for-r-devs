# Iterators

- The goal of this section is to go over iterators.
- First cover `.into_iter()` to create a consuming iterator this way the inner type is not a reference
- We can talk about the basic methods for iterators:
    - `.sum()`
    - `.min()`
    - `.max()`
    - `.min()`: not floating point arith issues here
    - `.max()`: note floating point arith issues here
    - `.enumerate()`
- should we touch on iter() here? we haven't yet talked about references. ideally we will have the students write the mean with `Vec<f64>` here
- then the next section we can

## Exercises

- calculate the mean using an iterator
- use an enumerated for loop to sum only even numbers



##  Exercise 1

- Rewrite the `mean()` function to use an iterator instead of a for loop
