# Parallelizing

- this is a stretch exercise

- Brief intro to rayon
- `par_iter()`
- `into_par_iter()`
- `with_min_len()`


- Objective is to calculate the pairwise distances between two vectors of points super fast
- we want to use `.zip()` to combine the two vectors
- this would require using rand to create a vector of random numbers
