# Basic Types

- much of what we do in rust are done on individual values (scalars)
- r work is typically done on vectors (collections of like values) and most operations are vectorized
- in rust we have to perform the vectorized ops our self



- i32
- i64 (exists but is incompatible with R, generally don't need it)
- usize
- f64
- f32 (exists don't we don't use it)

- type inference: e.g. `let x = 10;` infers i32
- explicit typing e.g. `let x = 10usize` or `let x: usize = 10`

`()` unit type - literally nothing
