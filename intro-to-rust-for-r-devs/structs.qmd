# Defining Struct(ure)s

::: callout-tip
## Objective

TODO
- create structs
- access fields
- destructure them
- understand partial moves
:::

- PascalCase naming convention
- deriving traits debug, clone: we won't discuss this much, but just _trust_ me
- destructuring assignment
- access fields of the struct
- partial moves

## Exercise

- Define a struct called `Point` which has two fields `x`, and `y`
- Create a new `Point` struct
- Destructure the point
