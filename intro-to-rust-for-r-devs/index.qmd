# Intro to Rust for R Developers {.unnumbered}

We've got 3 hours to cover a lot of ground! My goal is to get you all to a place where you can begin to *write vectorized code* by the end of the day.

I've prepared more content than I think we can actually coverâ€”let's prove me wrong!

::: aside

I'm going to skip a bunch of content that would be considered "foundational" Rust like `HashMap`s and traits. My goal is to get you to write usable code without having to feel like you're getting a CS degree.

## Timeline

This is the conservative timeline for the workshop. So long as we make it to "Mapping over iterators" we will be in good shape for the next workshop!
