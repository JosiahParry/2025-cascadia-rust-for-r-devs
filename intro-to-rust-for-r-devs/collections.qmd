# Basic Collections

## Introduce collections

- discuss arrays first
- arrays are fixed size
- vectors are not fixed sized
- arrays are better for performance but much more difficult to use
- creating vectors: `vec![]`
- debug format for println!();
- R is unique in that most things are vectorized that is not often the case
- in order to use vectors we need to iterate
- print the vector using debug format

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = vec![3, 6, 9, 12];
    println!("Vector is: {:?}", x);
}
```
