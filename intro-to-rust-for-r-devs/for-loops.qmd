# `for`-loops

::: callout-tip

## Objective

Be able to iterate over a collection of values. Apply logic inside of the for loop.

## `for` loop syntax

In Rust, `for` loops are the easiest way to go over each item in a vector or array.

```rust
for value in collection {
    // do something with value
}
```

When we iterate through a collection, each item takes on the value of the name you provide before `in`. For example `for x in my_vec` creates a binding to `x` at each iteration.

```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
    for n in nums {
        println!("n is: {}", n);
    }
}
```


## Scope

R has some of the most flexible and unique scoping rules. Rust isn't as kind. The rules are essentially:

* Values *outside* of the for loop are accessible inside of it.
* Values created *inside* of the for loop cannot be accessed outside of it.


### Example: Outer value used inside loop

:::{.callout-tip title = "This does compile" icon=false}
```rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = "Hi";
    let names = vec!["Alice", "Bob"];

    for name in names {
        println!("{greeting}, {name}!");
    }
}
```

### Example: Inner value not usable outside loop

::: callout-important
## This does not compile!


```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

    for n in numbers {
        let doubled = n * 2;
        println!("{n} doubled is {doubled}");
    }

    // ‚ùå `doubled` doesn't exist here
    // println!("Last doubled: {}", doubled);
}
```

## Exercise

Using a vector of integers, write a loop that prints:

* "Fizz" if divisible by 3
* "Buzz" if divisible by 5
* "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both
* The number otherwise

Use this vector: `vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15]`

```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15];

    for n in nums {
       // add fizz-buzz logic here referring to `n`
    }
}
```
