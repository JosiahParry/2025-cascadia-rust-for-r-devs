# Welcome!


# All installed?

- ✅ Positron
- ✅ Rust
- ✅ Rust Analyzer

## Bathroom breaks

- There will be 2 breaks at ~ each hour
- Please use the restroom during exercises if need be

## Exercises

- Red 🟥 "I need help"
- Green 🟩 "I'm done and ready to go!"

## Workshop Objective

- Zero to hero!
- Write basic Rust code with iteration
- Prepare for making R packages with Rust

# Why Rust?

- R is **interpreted**
- Rust is **compiled** like C, C++, Fortran, Go
- C++ speed with advantages

## Rust advantages

- Memory safe (no garbage collector)
- Friendly compiler errors
- Developer-oriented tooling:
- Low effort, high reward


# Hello, world!


## `cargo`

- Rust's package manager
- Installed with Rust
- Manages dependencies
- Helps set up projects

## Rust crates

- Rust uses "crates"
- Two types:
  - Binary—e.g. cli tools and web servers
  - Library—used by other Rust tools

## Your first crate!

Use `cargo new {name of crate}`

```bash
# create a new crate
cargo new intro-to-rust

cd intro-to-rust
```

## Crate anatomy

```bash
intro-to-rust/
├── Cargo.toml      # Metadata & dependencies (like DESCRIPTION)
├── Cargo.lock      # Dependency versions (like renv.lock)
└── src/
    └── main.rs     # Entry point — like main.R
```

## `main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- Functions are declared using the `fn` keyword
- The `main()` function is the entrypoint of the program (and required)
- Blocks of code are delimted using curly braces (like R & C)
- Statements end with `;`
- `println!()` is a macro (notice the `!`) which is used to print to `stdout`

## `println!()`

* Macros have a `!`, like `println!()`.
* Think of it like `print()` in R, but explicit.
* It supports format strings:

. . .

:::{layout-ncol=2}
#### Using placeholder
```rust
let name = "Josiah";
println!("Hello, {}!", name);
```

#### Direct interpolation
```rust
let name = "Josiah";
println!("Hello, {name}!");
```

# Basic Types

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Familiarize yourself with basic types in Rust and when they may be used.

:::


## Basic Types

- Everything in R is a **vector**
- Vectors are **collections** of scalars
- Scalars are the building block of everything in Rust
- Rust has explicit _collections_

## Integers

- Either **signed** or **unsigned**
- Signed can be _negative_
- Unsigned are strictly positive
- Signed Integers: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`
- Unsigned Integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`


. . .

::: callout-note
In R, an integer vector is comprised of `i32` values.
:::




:::{.notes}
The letter prefix is the type of primitive. The following number indicates how many bits can be used to store the values.
:::


## Floating Point

- **Signed** with decimal values
- Two types: `f32` and `f64`

. . .

::: callout-note
In R, a double vector is comprised of `f64` values.
:::


## Strong typing

- Rust _infers_ types very well
- Oftern we need to specify the type
- In assignment via `let x: f64 = 10;`
- Using a suffix e.g. `10f64` or `10_i32`

::: callout-tip
Use `_` as a visual separator when specifying numbers in Rust.
:::

## Type casting

- Must use like-types
- **Cannot** do `2_i32 + 3.14`
- Must _cast_ to a similar type using `as`

. . .

```rust
fn add2(x: f64, y: i32) -> f64 {
   x + y as f64
}
```

## Unit type

- No such thing as `NULL`
- `()` is the **unit** type
- Functions  that do not return anything return `()`

## Exercise

# Control Flow

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Understand control flow and numeric operators in Rust. You will create the `FizzBuzz` program using Rust!

:::


## Numeric operators

- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `/` division
- `%` remainder

## Logical Operators:

- Logical operators are quite similar to R.
- _Not_ vectorized
- Uses `bool` can only be `true` or `false`

- `==` check equality
- `!=` check inequality
- `!` negate a logical value
- `&&` logical AND comparison
- `||` logical OR comparison
- `^` logical XOR comparison (exclusive OR)


## Control flow

- `if`, `else`, and `else if` is similar to R
- Branches use `{}`

```rust
if x == y {
  // do something
} else {
  // do something else
}
```

## Exercise

# Arrays and Vectors

::: callout-tip

## Objective

Learn how to store multiple values of the same type in arrays and vectors. Understand the difference between arrays and vectors.
:::


## Arrays

- Fixed size
- Contain the same type
- Very fast
- Very inflexible

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
    println!("Array: {:?}", arr);
}
```

## Debug syntax

- The `{:?}` syntax is used for a [**Debug**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) representation of a variable.
- Using `{}` is used for [**Displaying**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) data
- Usually `{:?}` works whereas `{}` doesn't always

## Arrays

* Arrays use square brackets: `[1, 2, 3]`
* Their size is known at compile time
* You can't add or remove elements
* Mostly used when performance is critical and size is known
- Type is specified as `[type; length]`

## Vectors

- Growable arrays
- Much more flexible
- Must be the same type
- Construct using `vec![]`

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("Vector: {:?}", v);
}
```


## Vectors

- Specify type of a vector using `Vec<T>`
- Empty vectors with `Vec::new()`
- Empty vectors must have explicit type (or inferred)

. . .

::: callout-important
## Cannot compile
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Vec::new();
    println!("x is empty: {}", x.is_empty();
}
```
:::


## Array / Vector methods

- `x.len()` how many elements in the vector
- `.is_empty()`

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: Vec<f64> = Vec::new();
    println!("x is empty: {}", x.is_empty());
}
````


## Exercise

# `for`-loops

::: callout-tip

## Objective

Be able to iterate over a collection of values. Apply logic inside of the for loop.

:::

## `for` loop syntax

- Used to iterate through a **collection**

. . .

```rust
for value in collection {
    // do something with value
}
```


## `for` loop syntax

- Each iteration takes on the value of the name provided to `in`

```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
    for n in nums {
        println!("n is: {}", n);
    }
}
```


## Scope

* Values *outside* of the for loop are accessible inside of it.
* Values created *inside* of the for loop cannot be accessed outside of it.

. . .

::: columns

::: column

:::{.callout-tip title = "This does compile" icon=false}
```rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = "Hi";
    let names = vec!["Alice", "Bob"];

    for name in names {
        println!("{greeting}, {name}!");
    }
}
```
:::

::: callout-important
#### This does not compile!

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

    for n in numbers {
        let doubled = n * 2;
        println!("{n} doubled is {doubled}");
    }

    // ❌ `doubled` doesn't exist here
    // println!("Last doubled: {}", doubled);
}
```
:::

:::

:::

# Exercise

# Mutability

::: callout-tip
Understand the difference between immutable and mutable variables.
:::

## Mutability

- R everything is **immutable** (except environments)
- Immutable objects cannot be altered
- Rust variables are immutable by default
- Use `mut` to make them mutable
- Can override value use `var = new_val` _without_ `let`

. . .

```rust
let mut x = 5;
x = 6; // ✅ works because x is mutable
```

## Example

Revisiting our loop from earlier:

```rust
fn main() {
    // create a vector
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    // create a mutable value
    let mut doubled = 0;

    // iterate through numbers to update doubled
    for n in numbers {
        doubled = n * 2;
        println!("{} doubled is {}", n, doubled);
    }

    // ✅ compiles because `doubled` was declared
    // _outside_ of the inner loop scope
    println!("Last doubled: {}", doubled);
}
```

# Exercise

# Mutable Vectors

::: callout-tip
## Objective
Learn how to create and modify vectors with mutable operations.
:::

## Empty vectors

- Vectors are growable
- Must be `mut`(able) to grow or modify
- `Vec::new()` creates an empty vector.
- `.push()` adds an element to the end of a vector.

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut names = Vec::new();
    names.push("Alice");
    names.push("Bob");
    println!("{:?}", names);
}
```


## Clearing vectors

You can remove all elements from a vector using `.clear()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
    nums.clear();
    println!("{:?}", nums); // prints []
}
```

## Sorting vectors

Use `.sort()` to sort a vector. Important to note that not all types can be sorted.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = vec![11, 3, 7, 10, 1];
    println!("x before sorting: {x:?}");
    x.sort();
    println!("x after sorting:  {x:?}");
}
```
```
x before sorting: [11, 3, 7, 10, 1]
x after sorting:  [1, 3, 7, 10, 11]
```

## Combining vectors

- `.extend()` adds the contents of another vector.
- The original vector must be `mut`.
- The second vector is **moved** into the first.
- `b` can no longer be used.

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut a = vec![1, 2];
    let b = vec![3, 4];
    // note that we don't assign.
    // Instead, `a` is modified in place
    a.extend(b);
    println!("{:?}", a); // prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

# Exercise


# Functions

::: callout-tip
Learn how to define and use your own functions in Rust.
:::


## Functions

- Declared using `fn` keyword
- Last object in body is returned
- `return` is _only_ for early returns
- Arguments are typed

. . .

```rust
fn name_of_function(arg1: ArgType) -> ReturnType {
    // function body
    my_return_object
}
```

#

![](/images/is-odd.png){width=70%}


## Example

::: columns

::: column
```rust
fn is_even(x: i32) -> bool {
    x % 2 == 0
}
```

:::



::: column
```rust
fn is_odd(x: i32) -> bool {
    !is_even(x)
}
```
:::
:::

# Exercise


# Ownership

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Understand the how Rust ensures memory safety through the borrow checker and be able to avoid issues by borrowing, using a slice, or cloning.
:::


# Borrow checker

- Rust's memory safety net
- Enforces **ownership**

# Variables can be used only once

## Moves

- Variable **moved** when used by a function or method

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
    let y = x; // ⬅️ ownership moved
    println!("{:?}", x); // ❌ error: value used after move
}
```

- `x` was moved and cannot be used again

## Cloning

- Simple but inefficient way to reuse a variable
- Uses `.clone()` method
- Almost everything can be cloned
. . .

::: callout-tip
Remember: when in doubt, clone it out!
:::


## Example


::: callout-important

#### Cannot compile

```rust
let x  = v![0.0, 3.14, 10.1, 44.8];

let avg1 = mean(x); // ⬅️ x moved here!
let avg2 = mean(x); // ❌ compiler error
```
:::

. . .

::: callout-tip

#### Can compile

```rust
let x  = v![0.0, 3.14, 10.1, 44.8];

let avg1 = mean(x.clone()); // ⬅️ x cloned here!
let avg2 = mean(x); // ✅ compiler happy
```
:::

## Borrowing

- Variables can be **borrowed** infinitely
- Variables can be used by **reference**
- Create a reference (borrow) with `&`

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
    let avg = mean(&x); // 👈 borrowing `x`
    println!("x is still usable: {:?}", x);
}
```

## Slices

- A special type of borrowing
- A **contiguous** section of the same type
- Recognized by `&[T]`
- They have **known length** (e.g. has `.len()`)
- Can be provided by more than one type

## Example: slices

`[f64; N]` and a `Vec<f64>` can be a `&[f64]`

. . .

```rust
let x = [0.0, 20.0, 742.3];
let y = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];

let avg_x = mean(&x)
let avg_y = mean(&y);
```

## Slices

- Are more flexible
- Lightweight
- In general prefer:
  1. slice
  2. reference
  3. owned

# Exercises

# Iterators

::: callout-tip

## Objective

- Understand what an iterator is and how to create one.
- Learn the difference between `.iter()` and `.into_iter()`.
- Use basic iterator methods like `.sum()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, and `.enumerate()`.

:::


## Iterators

- Alternative way to iterate through a collection
- Often simpler when modifying a `Vec<T>`
- Produce a sequence of items that can be accessed or modified

## Consuming iterators

- `for` loops _consume_ the vector
- `for` loops create an iterator
- `.into_iter()` creates a consuming iterator
- `for xi in x` is identical to `for xi in x.into_iter()`

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![3, 6, 9];

    for n in nums.into_iter() {
        println!("Value: {n}");
    }

    // nums has been moved ❌
    // println!("nums: {:?}", nums);
}
```

## Borrowing iterators

- `.iter()` borrows the collection
- Each item is a `reference()`

. . .


```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![3, 6, 9];

    for n in nums.iter() {
        println!("Reference to value: {}", n);
    }
    // nums is still usable ✅
    println!("nums: {:?}", nums);
}
```

## Basic Iterator Methods

- `.sum()` — Add all the values together.
- `.min()` — Find the smallest value.
- `.max()` — Find the largest value.
- `.enumerate()` — Pairs each value with its index.

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![2, 4, 8];

    let total: i32 = nums.iter().sum(); // requires type annotation
    println!("Sum is: {}", total);
}
```

## Enumerated iterators

- Provide an index via `.enumerate()`
- Called after `.iter()`
- Each element is a **tuple** with `(i, xi)`

. . .

```rust
fn is_even(x: i32) -> bool {
    x % 2 == 0
}

fn main() {
    let x = vec![2, 4, 8];

    for (i, xi) in x.iter().enumerate() {
        if is_even(i as i32) {
            println!("i is even with value {xi}");
        }
    }
}
```

# Exercises


# Mapping over Iterators

::: callout-tip
## Objective
- Understand how to transform iterator values using `.map()`
- Learn how to use closures (anonymous functions) in Rust
- Collect iterator results back into a collection using `.collect()`
- Use turbofish 🐠💨 syntax for type annotations when needed
:::


# Mapping over iterators

- R we use `purrr::map()` or `apply()`
- Rust we can use `.iter().map()`

## Using `.map()`

- use `.map()` to modify an iterator
- returns another iterator

. . .

```rust
let x = vec![5.9f64, 6.8, 4.5, 7.3, 6.2];

x.iter().map(|xi| xi.powi(2))
```

## Closures

- Use a **closure** to modify each element
- Rust's anonymous function
- Format `|arg| expression`

. . .

```rust
x
    .iter()
    .map(|xi| {
        let squared = xi.powi(2);
        xi.sqrt()
    })
```

## Closures with enumerated iterators

- The enumerated tuple can be **destructured**

. . .

```rust
x
    .iter()
    .enumerate()
    .map(|(i, xi)| {
        // do stuff here
    })
```

## Collecting results

- `purrr::map()` returns a vector
- In Rust we have to **collect** the iterator via `.collect()`
- `.collect()` creates another collection
- Typically a `Vec<T>`
- Need to specify the type

. . .


```rust
let x_squared: Vec<f64> = x.iter().map(|xi| xi.powi(2)).collect();
```

## Turbofish 🐠💨

> "Because `collect()` is so general, it **can cause problems with type inference**. As such, `collect()` is one of the few times you’ll see the syntax affectionately known as the ‘turbofish’: `::<>`. This helps the inference algorithm understand specifically which collection you’re trying to collect into."

## Turbofish 🐠💨 Example


```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // Add 1 to each element
    let incremented = nums.iter()
        .map(|x| x + 1)
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();

    println!("{:?}", incremented);
}
```

# Defining Struct(ure)s

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Create new `struct` types and destructure them. Additionally, add behavior through `derive`-macros.
:::
