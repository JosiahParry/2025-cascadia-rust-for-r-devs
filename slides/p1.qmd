# Welcome!


# All installed?

- ‚úÖ Positron
- ‚úÖ Rust
- ‚úÖ Rust Analyzer

## Bathroom breaks

- There will be 2 breaks at ~ each hour
- Please use the restroom during exercises if need be

## Exercises

- Red üü• "I need help"
- Green üü© "I'm done and ready to go!"

## Workshop Objective

- Zero to hero!
- Write basic Rust code with iteration
- Prepare for making R packages with Rust

# Why Rust?

- R is **interpreted**
- Rust is **compiled** like C, C++, Fortran, Go
- C++ speed with advantages

## Rust advantages

- Memory safe (no garbage collector)
- Friendly compiler errors
- Developer-oriented tooling:
- Low effort, high reward


# Hello, world!


## `cargo`

- Rust's package manager
- Installed with Rust
- Manages dependencies
- Helps set up projects

## Rust crates

- Rust uses "crates"
- Two types:
  - Binary‚Äîe.g. cli tools and web servers
  - Library‚Äîused by other Rust tools

## Your first crate!

Use `cargo new {name of crate}`

```bash
# create a new crate
cargo new intro-to-rust

cd intro-to-rust
```

## Crate anatomy

```bash
intro-to-rust/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml      # Metadata & dependencies (like DESCRIPTION)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock      # Dependency versions (like renv.lock)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs     # Entry point ‚Äî like main.R
```

## `main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- Functions are declared using the `fn` keyword
- The `main()` function is the entrypoint of the program (and required)
- Blocks of code are delimted using curly braces (like R & C)
- Statements end with `;`
- `println!()` is a macro (notice the `!`) which is used to print to `stdout`

## `println!()`

* Macros have a `!`, like `println!()`.
* Think of it like `print()` in R, but explicit.
* It supports format strings:

. . .

:::{layout-ncol=2}
#### Using placeholder
```rust
let name = "Josiah";
println!("Hello, {}!", name);
```

#### Direct interpolation
```rust
let name = "Josiah";
println!("Hello, {name}!");
```

# Basic Types

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Familiarize yourself with basic types in Rust and when they may be used.

:::


## Basic Types

- Everything in R is a **vector**
- Vectors are **collections** of scalars
- Scalars are the building block of everything in Rust
- Rust has explicit _collections_

## Integers

- Either **signed** or **unsigned**
- Signed can be _negative_
- Unsigned are strictly positive
- Signed Integers: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`
- Unsigned Integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`


. . .

::: callout-note
In R, an integer vector is comprised of `i32` values.
:::




:::{.notes}
The letter prefix is the type of primitive. The following number indicates how many bits can be used to store the values.
:::


## Floating Point

- **Signed** with decimal values
- Two types: `f32` and `f64`

. . .

::: callout-note
In R, a double vector is comprised of `f64` values.
:::


## Strong typing

- Rust _infers__ types very well
- Oftern we need to specify the type
- In assignment via `let x: f64 = 10;`
- Using a suffix e.g. `10f64` or `10_i32`

::: callout-tip
Use `_` as a visual separator when specifying numbers in Rust.
:::

## Type casting

- Must use like-types
- **Cannot** do `2_i32 + 3.14`
- Must _cast_ to a similar type using `as`

. . .

```rust
fn add2(x: f64, y: i32) -> f64 {
   x + y as f64
}
```

## Unit type

- No such thing as `NULL`
- `()` is the **unit** type
- Functions  that do not return anything return `()`

## Exercise

# Control Flow

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Understand control flow and numeric operators in Rust. You will create the FizzBuzz program using Rust!

:::


## Numeric operators

- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `/` division
- `%` remainder

## Logical Operators:

- Logical operators are quite similar to R.
- _Not_ vectorized
- Uses `bool` can only be `true` or `false`

- `==` check equality
- `!=` check inequality
- `!` negate a logical value
- `&&` logical AND comparison
- `||` logical OR comparison


## Control flow

- `if`, `else`, and `else if` is similar to R
- Branches use `{}`

```rust
if x == y {
  // do something
} else {
  // do something else
}
```

## Exercise


# Arrays and Vectors

::: callout-tip

## Objective

Learn how to store multiple values of the same type in arrays and vectors. Understand the difference between arrays and vectors.
:::


## Arrays

- Fixed size
- Contain the same type
- Very fast
- Very inflexible

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
    println!("Array: {:?}", arr);
}
```

## Debug syntax

- The `{:?}` syntax is used for a [**Debug**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) representation of a variable.
- Using `{}` is used for [**Displaying**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) data
- Usually `{:?}` works whereas `{}` doesn't always

## Arrays

* Arrays use square brackets: `[1, 2, 3]`
* Their size is known at compile time
* You can't add or remove elements
* Mostly used when performance is critical and size is known
- Type is specified as `[type; length]`

## Vectors

- Growable arrays
- Much more flexible
- Must be the same type
- Construct using `vec![]`

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("Vector: {:?}", v);
}
```


## Vectors

- Specify type of a vector using `Vec<T>`
- Empty vectors with `Vec::new()`
- Empty vectors must have explicit type (or inferred)

. . .

::: callout-important
## Cannot compile
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Vec::new();
    println!("x is empty: {}", x.is_empty();
}
```
:::


## Array / Vector methods

- `x.len()` how many elements in the vector
- `.is_empty()`

. . .

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: Vec<f64> = Vec::new();
    println!("x is empty: {}", x.is_empty();
}
````


## Exercise

# `for`-loops

::: callout-tip

## Objective

Be able to iterate over a collection of values. Apply logic inside of the for loop.

:::

## `for` loop syntax

- Used to iterate through a **collection**

. . .

```rust
for value in collection {
    // do something with value
}
```


## `for` loop syntax

- Each iteration takes on the value of the name provided to `in`

```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
    for n in nums {
        println!("n is: {}", n);
    }
}
```


## Scope

* Values *outside* of the for loop are accessible inside of it.
* Values created *inside* of the for loop cannot be accessed outside of it.


. . .


::: columns

::: column
:::{.callout-tip title = "This does compile" icon=false}
```rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = "Hi";
    let names = vec!["Alice", "Bob"];

    for name in names {
        println!("{greeting}, {name}!");
    }
}
```
:::

:::

::: column

::: callout-important
#### This does not compile!


```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

    for n in numbers {
        let doubled = n * 2;
        println!("{n} doubled is {doubled}");
    }

    // ‚ùå `doubled` doesn't exist here
    // println!("Last doubled: {}", doubled);
}
```
:::

:::

## Exercise

# Mutability

::: callout-tip
Understand the difference between immutable and mutable variables.
:::

## Mutability

- R everything is **immutable** (except environments)
- Immutable objects cannot be altered
- Rust variables are immutable by default
- Use `mut` to make them mutable
- Can override value use `var = new_val` _without_ `let`

. . .

```rust
let mut x = 5;
x = 6; // ‚úÖ works because x is mutable
```

## Example

Revisiting our loop from earlier:

```rust
fn main() {
    // create a vector
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    // create a mutable value
    let mut doubled = 0;

    // iterate through numbers to update doubled
    for n in numbers {
        doubled = n * 2;
        println!("{} doubled is {}", n, doubled);
    }

    // ‚úÖ compiles because `doubled` was declared
    // _outside_ of the inner loop scope
    println!("Last doubled: {}", doubled);
}
```
